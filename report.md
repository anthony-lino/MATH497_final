# Abstract
Here Long Short-Term Memoery (LSTM) networks are trained on foreign exchanged Forex) from the past 5 yeras. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which are well suited to time series data because they process each time step independently, while retaining information about previous time steps, allowing them to be trained on time steps of arbitrary lengths. LSTMs improve on this by reducing the chances of exploding gradients that prevent model convergence. A 75-20-5 train-validation-test split is used, with the goal of getting a greater than chance accuracy on the test dataset
