# Abstract
Here Long Short-Term Memeory (LSTM) networks, are trained on foreign exchanges market (Forex) from the past 5 years. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which are well suited to time series data because they process each time step independently, while retaining information about previous time steps, allowing them to be trained on time steps of arbitrary lengths. LSTMs improve on this by reducing the chances of exploding gradients that prevent model convergence. A 75-20-5 train-validation-test split is used, with the goal of getting a greater than chance accuracy on the test dataset

# Introduction
Algorithmic trading plays an imporant part of our current economy, with participants being extremely secretive to maintain their technical lead. While there are large institutions devoted to this, there are publiclly available APIs that anyone can use for algorithmic trading, if they have the technical knowledge. Therefore, algorithmic trading is 

# Theory
The three algorithms being used here come from three different areas of math: 1) LSTMs come from deep learning, 2) ARIMA comes from regression, and 3) Markov models comes from the study of markov chains. 
## Deep Learning
LSTMs are a part of the methods developed in the deep learning field to perform tasks on sequential data. 

# Outline
- Intro: Millions of dollars are traded every minute on the stock market. Much of how this is work is secretive, so independent analysis is needed to learn about this field which is critically important for all investors or participants in the economy. In this study, we start by simple models from the three main approaches to forecasting data.
- Theory: Regressions are the simplest models. They have very few parameters, which makes them more resistant to overfitting and much more interpretable. Markov chains are the most interpretable, but generally perform the worst. Deep learning performs the best because it can capture much more complex relationships, but is not interpretable.
